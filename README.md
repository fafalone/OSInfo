# OSInfo
Universal compatibility version of OSInfo 1.15

This is an update to [Alex Dragokas' OSInfo class](https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?846709-OS-Version-information-class), which provides extensive information about the host OS and the user of the current process. It's been made universally compatible with VB6, VBA6, VBA7 32bit, VBA7 64bit, twinBASIC 32bit, and twinBASIC 64bit. 

**Requires twinBASIC Beta 412 or newer** for use under that.
